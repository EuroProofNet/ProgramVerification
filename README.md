# EuroProofNet WG3 on Software Verification

[EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io) is the European research network on digital proofs. **EuroProofNet aims at boosting the interoperability and usability of proof systems**. EuroProofNet is a COST action started on November 2021 gathering more than 300 researchers from more than 40 different countries.

The **aim** of [working group 3 (WG 3)](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg3/) is twofold:
- to lower the computational complexity and increase expressiveness of techniques for the verification of program correctness, and
- to strengthen synergies and interoperability between different proof systems to combine the benefits of the different methodologies underlying the proof systems to facilitate formal verification of both software and mathematics.

This repository collects material and documentation of project deliverables related to WG3. The contents are listed below.

## Wiki on Software Verification Tools

The working group maintains an inventory of software verification tools, which can be found at the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ProgramVerification/wiki) of this repository. 

The inventory is open to the community.

## Wiki on Software Verification Challenges

The working group is working on an inventory of software verification challenges, which can be found at the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/EuroProofNet/ProgramVerification/wiki) of this repository. 

The collection of challenges is ongoing work towards deliverable **D11. Collection of verification challenges with summary of working recipes for verifying them.** (see the [MoU of COST action CA20111](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20111/)).
